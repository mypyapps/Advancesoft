    <section class="page">

<p>This Privacy Policy explains how AdvanceSoft Pty Ltd (“AdvanceSoft”, “we”, “us”) handles personal information collected through this website and our software services. It is written to be clear and practical.</p>

<div class="hr"></div>

<h2>1. What this policy covers</h2>
<ul class="list">
  <li>This website (including the contact form)</li>
  <li>Pre-sales and consulting engagements</li>
  <li>Our analytics applications (web, iOS, Android) where we are the service provider</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Information we collect</h2>
<ul class="list">
  <li><strong>Website enquiries</strong>: information you submit (for example name, company, email, message)</li>
  <li><strong>Technical data</strong>: standard web server logs (for example IP address, user agent, timestamps) used for security and troubleshooting</li>
  <li><strong>Application data (where applicable)</strong>: data you choose to provide in our products (for example health, exercise, tasks, habits), subject to explicit consent and product-specific notices</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cookies and analytics:</strong> Our website does not use third-party analytics or advertising cookies. We may use essential cookies required for basic site operation (for example to support navigation and security settings in your browser).</p>
<h2>3. How we use information</h2>
<ul class="list">
  <li><strong>Provide our services</strong>: to respond to enquiries, prepare proposals, deliver consulting work, and manage our relationship with you (including account administration where applicable).</li>
  <li><strong>Operate and maintain</strong>: to run the website and any services you use, including basic troubleshooting, performance monitoring, and preventing or addressing abuse.</li>
  <li><strong>Communicate</strong>: to send service-related messages (for example replying to enquiries, arranging meetings, or providing updates you request).</li>
  <li><strong>Improve</strong>: to understand what features and content are useful, and to improve reliability and user experience. Where possible, we use aggregated or de-identified information for this purpose.</li>
  <li><strong>Compliance</strong>: to meet legal obligations, enforce our terms, and protect our rights and the rights of others.</li>
</ul>
<p>We aim to use personal information only for purposes that are consistent with the context in which it was collected, and to limit collection to what is reasonably necessary.</p>

<h2>4. Data sharing</h2>
<p>We do not sell personal information, and we do not share personal information for third parties’ own marketing purposes.</p>
<p>We may share personal information in the following situations:</p>
<ul class="list">
  <li><strong>Service providers</strong>: vendors who help us operate our website and services (for example hosting, email delivery, security monitoring, or customer support tooling). They are permitted to use personal information only to provide services to us.</li>
  <li><strong>At your direction</strong>: when you ask us to share information, or when you connect a third-party integration that requires transferring data to or from that provider.</li>
  <li><strong>Professional advisors</strong>: legal, accounting, or professional services where necessary for our business operations.</li>
  <li><strong>Legal and safety</strong>: to comply with law, respond to lawful requests, protect the security of our systems, or protect the rights, property, or safety of AdvanceSoft, our clients, or others.</li>
  <li><strong>Business changes</strong>: if we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, or sale of assets, information may be transferred as part of that transaction, subject to appropriate protections.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Third-party APIs and integrations</h2>
<p>Some AdvanceSoft applications may allow you to connect third-party services (for example Garmin Connect) to import or export your data. When you connect an integration:</p>
<ul class="list">
  <li><strong>You choose</strong> whether to connect it, and you control which account is connected.</li>
  <li><strong>Consent and scopes</strong>: we request only the permissions (scopes) needed to provide the integration features you enable.</li>
  <li><strong>No passwords</strong>: we do not receive your third-party account password. Authorisation typically occurs via the third party’s secure authorisation flow (for example OAuth).</li>
  <li><strong>Data accessed</strong>: we access and process only the data made available to us through the permissions you grant (for example activities and related metrics where you authorise this).</li>
  <li><strong>Revocation</strong>: you can disconnect an integration in the relevant product settings, and in many cases you can also revoke access from the third-party account settings.</li>
  <li><strong>Storage and processing</strong>: where integration features are enabled, we may store and process authorised third-party data on our servers to provide dashboards, insights, and sync behaviour. You can disconnect the integration to stop further data access.</li>
</ul>

<p>At this time, our third-party integration focus is Garmin Connect. Any additional integrations will be covered by updates to this policy.</p>

<p>Third-party services operate under their own terms and privacy notices. For Garmin Connect, the Garmin Connect privacy notice is available at:</p>
<ul class="list">
  <li><a href="https://www.garmin.com/privacy/connect">https://www.garmin.com/privacy/connect</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Where an integration is subject to a third-party developer agreement (for example Garmin’s), we follow the applicable requirements for notice, consent, and data handling as part of operating the integration.</p>

<p>Developer references:</p>
<ul class="list">
  <li>Garmin Connect Developer Program: <a href="https://developer.garmin.com/gc-developer-program/">https://developer.garmin.com/gc-developer-program/</a></li>
  <li>Garmin Connect Developer Program Agreement (PDF): <a href="https://developerportal.garmin.com/sites/default/files/Garmin%20Connect%20Developer%20Program%20Agreement.pdf">https://developerportal.garmin.com/sites/default/files/Garmin%20Connect%20Developer%20Program%20Agreement.pdf</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Security</h2>
<p>We take reasonable steps to protect personal information from unauthorised access, use, alteration, and loss. Measures may include:</p>
<ul class="list">
  <li>Encrypted connections for data in transit (for example HTTPS/TLS where available)</li>
  <li>Access controls and least-privilege permissions for systems and data</li>
  <li>Logging and monitoring to detect misuse and maintain service reliability</li>
  <li>Secure development and change practices appropriate to the service</li>
  <li>Incident response processes to investigate and address security events</li>
</ul>
<p>No method of transmission or storage is completely secure. We work to continually improve safeguards appropriate to the nature of the information and the services provided.</p>

<h2>7. Retention</h2>
<p>We keep personal information only for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this policy, unless a longer period is required or permitted by law.</p>
<ul class="list">
  <li><strong>Enquiries</strong>: information you submit through the website is retained long enough to respond and to maintain a record of our communications.</li>
  <li><strong>Integration data</strong>: where you enable a third-party integration (for example Garmin Connect), we retain the authorised data for as long as needed to provide the features you use. You can request deletion where applicable.</li>
  <li><strong>Security and integrity</strong>: we may retain limited logs for security, fraud prevention, and reliability.</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Your choices and rights</h2>
<p>You can make the following requests in relation to personal information we hold about you (subject to applicable laws):</p>
<ul class="list">
  <li><strong>Access</strong>: request a copy of personal information we hold about you.</li>
  <li><strong>Correction</strong>: request correction of inaccurate or out-of-date information.</li>
  <li><strong>Deletion</strong>: request deletion where we no longer need the information for the purposes described in this policy, and where permitted by law.</li>
  <li><strong>Withdraw consent</strong>: where processing is based on your consent (for example optional integrations), you can withdraw that consent by disconnecting the integration or contacting us.</li>
  <li><strong>Marketing preferences</strong>: if we send you non-essential communications, you can opt out using any unsubscribe mechanism provided or by contacting us.</li>
</ul>
<p>To make a request, contact us using the website contact page. We may need to verify your identity before responding.</p>
